# Here are some supplimental P5 challenges I have created. Try to complete them without looking at the example code!

## 1. Up and Down Horizontal line

### have a horizontal line move back and forth from top to bottom of screen
### Have a fixed horizontal line in the center of the screen. as the bouncing line moves from above to below the fixed line, make the fixed line 
 - as it returns to above the position of the fixed line, have the fixed line reappear.
 - bonus: change some part of the fixed line each time it reappears. (color? weight?)


### do the same as above, but create multiple lines that disappear and reappear in sequence.
- can you create a fixedLine function that takes its yPlacement as a parameter?

### refactor the  multiple dissappearing lines, calling fixedLine iteratively  using a for loop

## 2. circles on lines

### have an ellipse move across the screen, as it does it erases a line . when it bounces back, the line reapppears
### have a circle move back and forth across a line. the circle has noFill() applied to it. There is no line seen inside the circle

### can you get a circle to trace the path of a square on the page

### can you get the circle to follow trace the path of a square, while also seeing that square on the page?

### can you your moving circle have no fill, and you not see the line inside the circle
